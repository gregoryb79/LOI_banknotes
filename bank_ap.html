        The Anglo-Palestine Bank banknotes were the State of Israel's first official series of banknotes. They were issued by the Anglo-Palestine Bank according to the agreement made between the Government of Israel and the Anglo-Palestine Bank allowing the Bank to issue notes under its imprimatur.
        The American Banknote Company designed the banknotes based on various combinations of guilloches that were in the printer's stock, some of which had been used for printing banknotes for China. The notes were printed on paper with embedded colored dots for security.        
        At the time the banknotes were ordered, no one knew what the name of the new state would be, let alone its currency. It was therefore decided to print Palestine Pound on the notes.    
        The banknotes reached Israel secretly in July 1948. On August 17, the government passed a law declaring the notes legal tender, and they were put into circulation on the following day.
        In 1948, the exchange rate for one US Dollar averaged 0.25 Palestine Pound.
